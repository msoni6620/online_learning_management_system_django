Our plan is to develop a web application named Learning Log, which will enable users to record their interests in various topics and create journal entries as they gain knowledge about them. The homepage of Learning Log should provide an overview of the website and prompt visitors to sign up or log in. A user should be able to add new entries, start new topics, and view and update already existing items after logging in.
